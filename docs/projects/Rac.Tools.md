# Rac.Tools Project Documentation

## Project Overview

The `Rac.Tools` project provides comprehensive development tools and content creation utilities for the Rac game engine, including a level editor, shader editor, and build pipeline management. The system offers specialized tools for game content creation, asset optimization, and development workflow automation while maintaining integration with the engine's asset pipeline and development ecosystem.

### Key Design Principles

- **Specialized Content Creation**: Dedicated tools for different content types including levels, shaders, and assets
- **Build Pipeline Integration**: Automated asset processing and optimization through configurable build systems
- **Real-Time Preview**: Live preview capabilities for immediate feedback during content creation
- **Asset Pipeline Coordination**: Seamless integration with engine asset management and optimization systems
- **Extensible Tool Framework**: Modular architecture supporting custom tool development and workflow integration

### Performance Characteristics and Optimization Goals

The tools prioritize responsive real-time editing with immediate visual feedback while maintaining efficient asset processing for large-scale content creation. Build pipeline operations are optimized for batch processing and incremental building to support rapid iteration during development.

## Architecture Overview

The tools system follows a modular architecture where specialized editors and build tools operate independently while sharing common infrastructure and engine integration patterns. Each tool category addresses specific content creation workflows while maintaining consistent user experience and asset management patterns.

### Core Architectural Decisions

- **Modular Tool Architecture**: Independent tool applications with shared infrastructure and common patterns
- **Real-Time Editing Support**: Live preview and immediate feedback systems for responsive content creation
- **Build Pipeline Automation**: Configurable asset processing workflows with incremental building capabilities
- **Engine Integration**: Direct integration with engine systems for accurate preview and testing
- **Configuration-Driven Workflows**: Customizable tool behavior through configuration files and project settings

### Integration with ECS System and Other Engine Components

Development tools integrate with ECS through level editing capabilities that manipulate entities and components directly. Shader tools coordinate with the rendering system for real-time preview, while build tools process assets for optimal engine consumption and runtime performance.

**ShaderEditorApp**: Specialized shader development environment providing code editing, compilation, and real-time preview capabilities. Supports multiple shader types including vertex, fragment, and compute shaders with visual debugging and performance analysis for graphics development workflows.

## Core Concepts and Workflows

### Level Creation Pipeline

Level editing encompasses scene construction, entity placement, component configuration, and lighting setup. The system provides visual editing tools with real-time preview, enabling intuitive game world creation with immediate feedback and validation.

### Shader Development Workflow

Shader development includes code editing, compilation, real-time preview, and performance analysis. The system supports multiple graphics APIs while providing visual debugging tools and immediate feedback for graphics programming workflows.

### Build Pipeline Management

Build systems coordinate asset processing including optimization, compression, platform-specific processing, and packaging. The pipeline supports incremental building, dependency tracking, and parallel processing for efficient content delivery preparation.

### Asset Integration Patterns

Tools coordinate with the engine asset system for consistent asset handling, optimization, and runtime integration. The system ensures tool-created content integrates seamlessly with engine workflows and performance characteristics.

## Integration Points

### Dependencies on Other Engine Projects

- **Rac.Core**: Configuration management and logging infrastructure for tool operations
- **Rac.ECS**: Entity and component manipulation for level editing and scene construction
- **Rac.Rendering**: Shader compilation and graphics preview for shader development tools
- **Rac.Assets**: Asset processing pipeline integration and content optimization

### How Other Systems Interact with Rac.Tools

Development workflows utilize tools for content creation and asset processing. Engine systems consume tool-generated assets including levels, shaders, and optimized resources. Version control systems manage tool-created content as part of project source assets.

### Data Consumed from ECS

Level editors manipulate entity hierarchies and component configurations directly. Tools query engine systems for accurate preview and validation while maintaining consistency with runtime engine behavior and performance characteristics.

## Usage Patterns

### Common Setup Patterns

Tool initialization involves engine integration setup, asset pipeline configuration, and user interface initialization. The system supports both standalone tool usage and integrated development environment workflows depending on project requirements.

### How to Use the Project for Entities from ECS

Level editing tools provide direct entity manipulation including component addition, property editing, and hierarchy management. The tools generate level data compatible with engine loading systems while maintaining ECS architecture consistency.

### Resource Loading and Management Workflows

Tools manage content assets through the engine asset system while providing specialized editing capabilities. The system supports both immediate editing and batch processing workflows for different content creation scenarios.

### Performance Optimization Patterns

Optimal tool performance requires efficient real-time preview systems, responsive user interface operations, and optimized asset processing pipelines. Large-scale content creation benefits from background processing and incremental update systems.

## Extension Points

### How to Add New Tool Features

New development tools can be added through the modular architecture including custom editors, specialized build steps, or workflow automation tools. The system supports plugin-style extensions while maintaining integration with engine systems.

### Extensibility Points

Tool interfaces support custom editing capabilities while build pipelines enable additional asset processing steps. Configuration systems allow project-specific customization and the tools support integration with external content creation applications.

### Future Enhancement Opportunities

The tools architecture supports advanced features including collaborative editing systems, version control integration, automated testing workflows, and cloud-based content processing. Analytics integration can provide content creation insights while performance profiling can optimize tool efficiency and user experience.
