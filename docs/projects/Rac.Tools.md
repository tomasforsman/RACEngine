Rac.Tools Project Documentation
Project Overview
The Rac.Tools project is a planned implementation for comprehensive development tools within the RACEngine ecosystem. This project is currently in the conceptual phase with placeholder classes defining the intended development tool capabilities for professional game development workflows.
Planned Features

Level Editor: Visual scene editing with object placement, terrain modification, and asset management
Shader Editor: Integrated development environment for shader programming with real-time preview
Build Pipeline: Automated asset processing and game packaging for multiple deployment targets
Integrated Development Environment: Comprehensive tools for RACEngine game development

Current Implementation Status
⚠️ Not Implemented: All classes in this project contain placeholder code with TODO comments.
Namespace Organization
Rac.Tools.BuildPipeline: Reserved for build automation and asset processing systems including Builder class for automated compilation and packaging workflows.
Rac.Tools.LevelEditor: Reserved for visual scene editing tools including LevelEditorApp for scene management and EditorUI for user interface implementation.
Rac.Tools.ShaderEditor: Reserved for shader development environment including ShaderEditorApp for integrated shader programming with syntax highlighting and real-time preview capabilities.
Configuration Infrastructure
config_default.ini: Comprehensive configuration template demonstrating advanced window and rendering options for development tools. Includes detailed documentation for all available settings including window properties, graphics API selection, performance tuning, and platform-specific options.
Future Development
This project represents planned development tools that will provide professional-grade game development capabilities comparable to industry-standard engines. Implementation will focus on productivity features, visual editing capabilities, and streamlined asset workflows to support efficient game development processes.
The configuration infrastructure demonstrates the sophisticated customization capabilities planned for development tools, enabling developers to optimize their development environment for specific hardware configurations and workflow preferences.
