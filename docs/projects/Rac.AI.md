Rac.AI Project Documentation
Project Overview
The Rac.AI project is a planned implementation for artificial intelligence systems within the RACEngine. This project is currently in the conceptual phase with placeholder interfaces defining the intended AI capabilities for game development.
Planned Features

Behavior Tree System: Hierarchical decision-making structures for complex AI behaviors
Pathfinding Algorithms: Spatial navigation and route planning for AI entities
Modular AI Architecture: Extensible system supporting multiple AI paradigms and algorithms

Current Implementation Status
⚠️ Not Implemented: All classes and interfaces in this project contain placeholder code with TODO comments.
Namespace Organization
Rac.AI.BehaviorTree: Reserved for behavior tree implementation including IBehaviorTree interface and BehaviorTree class for hierarchical AI decision systems.
Rac.AI.Pathfinder: Reserved for pathfinding algorithms including IPathfinder interface and AStarPathfinder implementation for spatial navigation.
Future Development
This project represents planned AI capabilities that will integrate with the ECS system to provide intelligent behavior for game entities. Implementation will focus on performance-optimized algorithms suitable for real-time game scenarios.
