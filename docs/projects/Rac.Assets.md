Rac.Assets Project Documentation
Project Overview
The Rac.Assets project is a planned implementation for asset management systems within the RACEngine. This project is currently in the conceptual phase with placeholder interfaces defining the intended asset pipeline capabilities for game development.
Planned Features

Asset Import Pipeline: Support for industry-standard 3D model and texture formats
Asset Loading: Efficient runtime asset loading with memory management
Serialization Systems: Data persistence and asset format conversion

Current Implementation Status
⚠️ Not Implemented: All classes and interfaces in this project contain placeholder code with TODO comments.
Namespace Organization
Rac.Assets.Importer: Reserved for asset import functionality including IModelImporter interface and AssimpModelImporter class for 3D model processing.
Rac.Assets.Loader: Reserved for runtime asset loading including ITextureLoader interface and StbImageLoader class for image asset handling.
Rac.Assets.Serializer: Reserved for data serialization including ISerializer interface and JsonSerializer class for asset data persistence.
Future Development
This project represents planned asset management capabilities that will provide a complete pipeline from content creation tools to runtime asset usage within games.
