# Rac.Assets Project Documentation

## Project Overview

The `Rac.Assets` project provides comprehensive asset management capabilities for the Rac game engine, handling the complete asset pipeline from import and loading to serialization and runtime management. This system enables efficient resource handling for textures, models, audio files, and other game assets while supporting multiple formats and optimized memory usage patterns.

### Key Design Principles

- **Pipeline Architecture**: Clear separation between import, loading, and serialization phases for optimal resource handling
- **Format Agnostic**: Extensible design supporting multiple asset formats through pluggable importers and loaders
- **Memory Optimization**: Asset sharing, pooling, and efficient memory management for large resource sets
- **Hot-Reloading Support**: Development-time asset updates without application restart for improved iteration speed
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking asset streaming to maintain frame-rate during resource loading

### Performance Characteristics and Optimization Goals

The asset system prioritizes memory efficiency and loading performance through strategic caching, resource pooling, and asynchronous loading patterns. Asset sharing prevents duplicate memory allocation for commonly used resources, while the import pipeline pre-processes assets for optimal runtime performance.

## Architecture Overview

The asset management system follows a three-stage pipeline architecture where importers handle format conversion, loaders manage runtime resource creation, and serializers provide persistent storage and transmission capabilities. This separation enables flexible asset workflows while maintaining consistent interfaces across different resource types.

### Core Architectural Decisions

- **Three-Stage Pipeline**: Import → Load → Serialize workflow enables format flexibility and runtime optimization
- **Interface-Driven Design**: Pluggable importers and loaders support multiple asset formats without core system changes
- **Lazy Loading Strategy**: Assets loaded on-demand to minimize memory footprint and startup time
- **Resource Identification**: Consistent asset referencing system for dependency management and resource sharing
- **Format Abstraction**: Common asset representation layer isolating runtime code from format-specific details

### Integration with ECS System and Other Engine Components

The asset system integrates with ECS through component-based asset references, enabling entities to reference textures, models, and other resources through lightweight identifiers. The rendering system consumes processed asset data for GPU upload, while the audio system accesses sound resources through the same unified interface.

## Namespace Organization

### Rac.Assets.Importer

Handles the conversion of external asset formats into engine-optimized representations during development and build processes.

**IModelImporter**: Defines the contract for 3D model importers that convert external formats (FBX, OBJ, GLTF) into engine-specific mesh and material data. Supports scene graph extraction, material mapping, and animation data processing.

**AssimpModelImporter**: Implementation using the Assimp library for comprehensive 3D model import capabilities. Provides support for industry-standard formats with automatic mesh optimization, texture coordinate generation, and material property extraction.

### Rac.Assets.Loader

Manages runtime asset loading operations, creating GPU resources and engine-ready data structures from imported assets.

**ITextureLoader**: Interface for texture loading operations that create GPU texture objects from processed image data. Handles format conversion, mipmap generation, and texture parameter configuration for rendering system integration.

**StbImageLoader**: Implementation using the STB Image library for runtime texture loading. Supports common image formats (PNG, JPEG, TGA) with automatic format detection and efficient memory management for texture data processing.

### Rac.Assets.Serializer

Provides asset serialization and persistence capabilities for save games, asset streaming, and data transmission scenarios.

**ISerializer**: Generic serialization interface supporting multiple data formats and use cases. Enables asset metadata persistence, save game data management, and network asset transmission with consistent API patterns.

**JsonSerializer**: JSON-based serialization implementation for human-readable asset metadata and configuration files. Supports asset dependency tracking, configuration persistence, and development-time asset management workflows.

## Core Concepts and Workflows

### Asset Pipeline and Data Flow

The asset workflow follows a structured pipeline from development assets to runtime resources:

1. **Import Phase**: External assets converted to engine format during build process
2. **Processing Phase**: Optimization, compression, and platform-specific preparation
3. **Loading Phase**: Runtime creation of GPU resources and engine data structures
4. **Management Phase**: Reference tracking, memory management, and lifecycle coordination

### Resource Management

Asset lifecycle management encompasses loading, sharing, and cleanup operations with automatic reference counting and memory pool utilization. The system tracks asset dependencies to ensure proper loading order and prevents resource leaks through deterministic cleanup patterns.

### Asset Pipeline Workflow

Development assets undergo processing through configurable pipelines that optimize resources for target platforms. The import system handles format conversion while maintaining source asset integrity, enabling rapid iteration and platform-specific optimizations.

### Integration with ECS

Assets integrate with the ECS through component-based references where entities store asset identifiers rather than direct resource pointers. This pattern enables efficient asset sharing, simplified memory management, and consistent resource lifecycle coordination across the game engine.

## Integration Points

### Dependencies on Other Engine Projects

- **Rac.Core**: Foundation utilities for configuration management and logging infrastructure
- **Rac.Rendering**: Texture and mesh data structures for GPU resource creation
- **Rac.Audio**: Sound resource interfaces and audio data management
- **Rac.ECS**: Component-based asset referencing and entity resource associations

### How Other Systems Interact with Rac.Assets

The rendering system queries the asset manager for texture and mesh resources during GPU upload operations. Audio systems access sound assets through the loading interface, while the ECS coordinates asset lifecycle through entity component associations. Development tools utilize serialization capabilities for asset metadata and pipeline configuration.

### Data Consumed from ECS

Asset components attached to entities provide resource identifiers that the asset system resolves to loaded resources. Transform data influences asset streaming priorities, while entity lifecycle events trigger appropriate asset loading and cleanup operations.

## Usage Patterns

### Common Setup Patterns

Asset manager initialization involves registering importers and loaders for supported formats, configuring memory pools for efficient allocation, and establishing asset search paths for resource discovery. The system supports both immediate loading for critical assets and lazy loading for optional resources.

### How to Use the Project for Entities from ECS

Entities reference assets through lightweight component data containing asset identifiers or paths. The asset system resolves these references to loaded resources during rendering or other operations, enabling efficient asset sharing across multiple entities without duplicate memory allocation.

### Resource Loading and Management Workflows

Asset loading supports both synchronous and asynchronous patterns depending on performance requirements. Critical assets can be preloaded during initialization while optional resources load on-demand. The system provides progress tracking for complex loading operations and handles loading failures gracefully.

### Performance Optimization Patterns

Optimal performance requires strategic asset preloading, efficient memory pool configuration, and appropriate caching strategies. Hot-path resources should be loaded early while rarely-used assets can utilize lazy loading. Asset streaming enables handling of large resource sets that exceed available memory.

## Extension Points

### How to Add New Asset Features

New asset types can be integrated by implementing the importer and loader interfaces for the specific format. The system's interface-driven design enables adding support for new formats without modifying core asset management code, maintaining backward compatibility and system stability.

### Extensibility Points

The plugin architecture supports custom importers for proprietary formats, specialized loaders for platform-specific optimizations, and custom serializers for unique persistence requirements. Asset metadata can be extended through the serialization system to support additional workflow information.

### Future Enhancement Opportunities

The asset system architecture supports advanced features including asset compression, streaming optimization, cloud asset delivery, and real-time asset modification. Development tool integration can be enhanced through asset dependency visualization, performance profiling, and automated optimization suggestions.
