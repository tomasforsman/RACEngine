Rac.Animation Project Documentation
Project Overview
The Rac.Animation project is a planned implementation for animation systems within the RACEngine. This project is currently in the conceptual phase with placeholder interfaces defining the intended animation capabilities for game development.
Planned Features

Skeletal Animation: Bone-based character animation with hierarchical transformations
Animation Blending: Smooth transitions between multiple animation states
Animation Playback: Timeline-based animation control and state management

Current Implementation Status
⚠️ Not Implemented: All classes and interfaces in this project contain placeholder code with TODO comments.
Namespace Organization
Rac.Animation.Animator: Reserved for animation system implementation including IAnimationPlayer interface, SkeletalAnimator class for character animation, and BlendTree class for animation state blending.
Future Development
This project represents planned animation capabilities that will integrate with the rendering system to provide smooth, performant character and object animation for games.
