# Rac.Engine Project Documentation

## Project Overview

The `Rac.Engine` project implements a comprehensive facade layer that orchestrates and simplifies access to all RACEngine subsystems. This implementation provides a unified interface for game development, coordinating the Entity-Component-System, rendering pipeline, input handling, audio services, and camera management through a clean, event-driven architecture.

### Key Design Principles

- **Facade Pattern**: Simplified interface hiding subsystem complexity and coordination details
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Centralized event coordination for lifecycle management and input handling
- **Dependency Injection Support**: Modular construction enabling testability and service substitution
- **Service Integration**: Seamless coordination between ECS, rendering, input, audio, and camera systems
- **Null Object Pattern**: Safe fallback implementations preventing null reference exceptions
- **Lifecycle Management**: Coordinated initialization, update, and cleanup across all subsystems

## Architecture Overview

The Rac.Engine system implements a sophisticated facade architecture that unifies access to distributed game engine subsystems. The facade coordinates complex interactions between systems while presenting a simplified interface for game development, enabling rapid prototyping and clear separation between engine infrastructure and game logic.

### Core Architectural Decisions

- **Single Entry Point**: Unified access to all engine services through a single facade interface
- **Event Hub Architecture**: Centralized event coordination eliminating direct subsystem dependencies
- **Service Caching**: Performance optimization through constructor-time service resolution
- **Modular Service Provision**: Support for both simple facades and dependency-injected implementations
- **Camera Integration**: Built-in dual-camera system coordination for world and UI rendering

### Integration with Engine Subsystems

The engine facade coordinates five major subsystems through well-defined interfaces. The ECS World provides entity management and component storage, while the SystemScheduler handles system execution and timing. The rendering system consumes transformation data and provides visual output, with the camera manager coordinating view transformations. Input services provide event-driven user interaction, and the audio system manages sound and music playback.

## Namespace Organization

### Rac.Engine

The root namespace contains the primary facade implementations and program entry point that coordinate all engine subsystems.

**IEngineFacade**: Core engine interface defining the complete service contract. Provides access to IWorld interface, Systems, Renderer, Audio, CameraManager, and WindowManager services. Exposes lifecycle events including LoadEvent, UpdateEvent, and RenderEvent, along with input events for keyboard and mouse interaction. Enables system registration and engine execution control. **New in latest version**: Includes entity management convenience methods (CreateEntity, DestroyEntity, EntityCount) for streamlined entity operations.

**EngineFacade**: Primary facade implementation that wraps the underlying GameEngine with simplified access patterns. Coordinates service initialization, event forwarding, and camera system integration. Provides automatic camera matrix updates during rendering and handles window resize events for proper viewport management.

**ModularEngineFacade**: Enhanced facade implementation supporting dependency injection and advanced logging capabilities. Caches all service references during construction for optimal performance and provides detailed debugging information through integrated logging. Follows modular architecture principles for improved testability and maintainability.

**Program**: Application entry point demonstrating basic engine initialization and execution. Shows standard subsystem construction pattern including WindowManager, InputService, and ConfigManager setup. Provides template for minimal engine application structure.

## Core Concepts and Workflows

### Facade Coordination Pattern

The engine facade implements a coordination pattern where complex subsystem interactions are encapsulated behind a simplified interface. Services are resolved once during construction and cached for performance, eliminating runtime service resolution overhead. The facade forwards events from underlying systems while providing additional coordination logic for camera updates and window management.

### Event-Driven Lifecycle Management

Engine operation follows an event-driven lifecycle where the facade coordinates timing across subsystems. The LoadEvent fires once during initialization before any update cycles begin. UpdateEvent executes each frame after ECS system processing, enabling game logic to respond to entity state changes. RenderEvent fires immediately before rendering operations, allowing final visual state preparation.

### Service Integration Strategy

The facade integrates services through interface-based contracts, enabling service substitution and testing. The IWorld interface provides entity and component management with support for both concrete World instances and NullWorld test implementations. The SystemScheduler provides behavior execution coordination. The IRenderer interface abstracts graphics implementation details while the ICameraManager coordinates view transformations. Audio and input services operate independently with event-based communication patterns.

**Interface-Based Design**: All major services follow consistent interface patterns (IWorld, IRenderer, IAudioService) enabling dependency injection, testing with mock implementations, and runtime service substitution. The World service specifically supports both production ECS functionality and headless testing scenarios through the NullWorld implementation.

### Camera System Coordination

Camera management operates through automatic integration with window and rendering systems. The CameraManager provides dual-camera capabilities supporting both world-space game rendering and screen-space UI overlay. The facade automatically updates camera matrices during render cycles and handles viewport changes during window resize events.

## Integration Points

### Dependencies on Other Engine Projects

- **Rac.ECS**: Entity-Component-System providing World and SystemScheduler services
- **Rac.Rendering**: Graphics pipeline including IRenderer and camera management systems
- **Rac.Input**: Input handling services for keyboard and mouse interaction events
- **Rac.Audio**: Audio services for sound and music playback (with null object fallback)
- **Rac.Core**: Foundation services including WindowManager and ConfigManager infrastructure
- **Rac.GameEngine**: Underlying engine implementation providing core game loop and service coordination

### Service Coordination Patterns

The facade coordinates services through event forwarding and automatic state synchronization. Input events from the underlying input service are forwarded to facade event handlers, enabling game logic to respond to user interaction without direct input system dependencies. Camera matrices are automatically synchronized with the renderer during each frame, ensuring visual consistency without manual coordination.

Window resize events trigger automatic viewport updates across the camera system and renderer, maintaining proper aspect ratios and projection matrices. The facade also coordinates ECS system execution timing with rendering cycles, ensuring entity state changes are reflected in visual output.

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Engine Initialization

Standard engine setup involves constructing required subsystems and injecting them into the facade. The WindowManager provides window management capabilities, while the InputService handles user interaction. The ConfigManager enables runtime configuration management for engine settings and game parameters.

```csharp
// Basic engine initialization pattern
var windowManager = new WindowManager();
var inputService = new SilkInputService();  
var configManager = new ConfigManager();

var engine = new EngineFacade(windowManager, inputService, configManager);
```

### System Registration and Game Logic

Game systems are registered through the AddSystem method, which delegates to the underlying SystemScheduler. Systems implementing ISystem receive automatic execution during update cycles with delta time for frame-rate independent behavior.

```csharp
// System registration pattern
engine.AddSystem(new TransformSystem());
engine.AddSystem(new CustomGameSystem());

// Event handling for game logic
engine.UpdateEvent += deltaTime => {
    // Custom game logic after ECS updates
};
```

### Entity Management Convenience Methods

The facade provides simplified entity management through convenience methods that delegate to the underlying IWorld implementation. These methods reduce API surface area and provide common operations without requiring knowledge of the World implementation details.

```csharp
// Simplified entity creation and management
var player = engine.CreateEntity();
var enemy = engine.CreateEntity();

// Entity destruction (placeholder implementation)
engine.DestroyEntity(enemy);

// Entity count monitoring
var totalEntities = engine.EntityCount;
Console.WriteLine($"Active entities: {totalEntities}");

// Advanced scenarios can still access the full IWorld interface
var specificEntity = engine.World.CreateEntity();
engine.World.SetComponent(specificEntity, new TransformComponent());
```

### Event-Driven Game Development

The facade provides event-driven development patterns through lifecycle and input events. LoadEvent enables one-time initialization, while UpdateEvent and RenderEvent provide frame-based execution hooks. Input events enable responsive user interaction without direct input system coupling.

```csharp
// Event-driven game development pattern
engine.LoadEvent += () => {
    // Initialize game state
};

engine.UpdateEvent += deltaTime => {
    // Frame-based game logic
};

engine.KeyEvent += (key, keyEvent) => {
    // Respond to keyboard input
};
```

### Camera System Access

Camera operations utilize the integrated CameraManager for dual-camera rendering scenarios. The GameCamera provides world-space transformations for game objects, while the UICamera enables pixel-perfect interface rendering. Coordinate transformations support mouse picking and screen-to-world positioning.

```csharp
// Camera system usage patterns
var gameCamera = engine.CameraManager.GameCamera;
gameCamera.Position = new Vector2D<float>(100, 50);
gameCamera.Zoom = 1.5f;

// Screen-to-world coordinate transformation
var worldPos = engine.CameraManager.ScreenToGameWorld(
    mousePosition, 
    engine.WindowManager.Size.X, 
    engine.WindowManager.Size.Y
);
```

## Extension Points

### Custom Service Integration

The facade architecture supports custom service integration through interface extension and service replacement patterns. New services can be integrated by extending the IEngineFacade interface and implementing coordination logic in concrete facade implementations.

Custom audio services can replace the default NullAudioService by implementing IAudioService and modifying facade construction. Similarly, custom rendering implementations can be substituted through the IRenderer interface without affecting other engine systems.

### Event System Extensions

The event system supports extension through additional event types and custom event coordination patterns. New lifecycle events can be added to the facade interface for specialized coordination requirements. Input event extensions can provide support for additional input devices or custom interaction patterns.

### Modular Architecture Enhancements

The ModularEngineFacade demonstrates advanced extension patterns through dependency injection and service caching. Custom facade implementations can provide specialized coordination logic for specific game types or deployment scenarios while maintaining interface compatibility.

Service resolution can be extended through dependency injection containers or service registry patterns. Custom logging implementations can be integrated through the ILogger interface for specialized debugging or telemetry requirements.

### Future Enhancement Opportunities

The facade architecture enables numerous enhancements without fundamental changes to the interface contract. Potential extensions include save/load coordination across subsystems, networked multiplayer service integration, and advanced profiling capabilities.

Performance enhancements may include async service initialization, background asset loading coordination, and advanced memory management across subsystems. Quality-of-life improvements could add hot-reload capabilities for game systems and runtime configuration updates.

The modular architecture provides a foundation for these enhancements while maintaining clean separation between engine infrastructure and game logic, ensuring that engine improvements benefit all games built on the platform.
