# Rac.Engine Project Documentation

## Project Overview

The `Rac.Engine` project serves as the application entry point and high-level orchestration layer for the RACEngine game engine. This project implements the facade pattern to provide simplified, unified access to the complex ecosystem of engine subsystems while managing their initialization, coordination, and lifecycle.

### Key Design Principles

- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface that wraps complex subsystem interactions
- **Service Orchestration**: Coordinates initialization and communication between engine subsystems
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses events to decouple game logic from engine internals
- **Dependency Injection Support**: Enables testable and modular service composition
- **Null Object Pattern**: Gracefully handles optional subsystems through null object implementations
- **Performance-First**: Caches service references and minimizes runtime overhead

### Performance Characteristics and Optimization Goals

The engine facade prioritizes minimal runtime overhead through aggressive service caching and efficient event propagation. All services are resolved once during construction and cached for the application lifetime. Event handlers use direct delegate invocation to minimize frame-time impact during critical game loop phases.

## Architecture Overview

The Rac.Engine system operates as a coordination layer that sits between application code and the underlying engine infrastructure. It wraps the core `GameEngine.Engine` class while providing integrated access to ECS, rendering, audio, input, and camera management systems.

### Core Architectural Decisions

- **Facade Composition**: Engine facade composes multiple subsystem interfaces rather than inheriting functionality
- **Event Pipeline Architecture**: Structured event flow from low-level engine events to high-level application callbacks
- **Service Caching Strategy**: All dependencies resolved during construction to eliminate runtime service location overhead
- **Modular Implementation**: Multiple facade implementations support different application patterns (basic vs dependency injection)
- **Resource Management**: Automatic lifecycle management with deterministic cleanup patterns

### Integration with ECS System and Other Engine Components

The engine facade provides direct access to the ECS `World` and `SystemScheduler`, enabling applications to register custom systems and manage entities through a unified interface. The facade coordinates ECS updates within the main game loop, ensuring proper timing and execution order across all engine systems.

## Namespace Organization

### Rac.Engine

The primary namespace contains all engine orchestration types and represents the complete public API surface for application development.

**Program**: Application entry point that demonstrates basic engine construction patterns. Instantiates core subsystems (window management, input services, configuration) and delegates execution to the engine facade.

**IEngineFacade**: Defines the contract for engine facade implementations. Establishes the complete service interface including ECS access, rendering, audio, camera management, window operations, and the event system for lifecycle management.

**EngineFacade**: Basic facade implementation that provides direct access to all engine subsystems. Handles service initialization, event pipeline setup, and coordinates the integration between ECS updates and rendering operations. Implements camera system integration for dual-camera scenarios (game world and UI).

**ModularEngineFacade**: Advanced facade implementation with comprehensive dependency injection support and diagnostic logging. Provides the same interface as EngineFacade while adding logging capabilities and flexible service resolution patterns for complex application architectures.

## Core Concepts and Workflows

### Engine Facade Lifecycle

The engine facade manages the complete application lifecycle from initialization through execution and cleanup. Construction involves service resolution, event pipeline setup, and subsystem coordination. The facade ensures proper initialization order and establishes communication pathways between subsystems before starting the main game loop.

### Event Pipeline Management

The event system provides structured communication between engine internals and application logic. Events flow from the core game loop through the facade to application handlers, enabling clean separation between engine concerns and game-specific logic. The pipeline supports load events (one-time initialization), update events (frame-rate independent logic), render events (graphics operations), and input events (user interaction).

### Service Coordination Patterns

Engine services operate through a coordinated pattern where the facade manages dependencies and ensures proper initialization order. The ECS system integrates with rendering through transform data, input systems query ECS for interaction targets, and the camera manager provides matrices for rendering operations. Service coordination eliminates the need for direct inter-system communication.

### Resource Management Workflow

Resource management follows a centralized pattern where the facade coordinates allocation, usage, and cleanup across all subsystems. The facade ensures that graphics resources, audio assets, and other managed resources are properly disposed during application shutdown, preventing resource leaks and enabling clean application termination.

## Integration Points

### Engine Dependencies

- **Rac.GameEngine**: Provides the core game loop orchestrator and low-level engine infrastructure
- **Rac.ECS**: Supplies the entity-component-system for game object management and logic execution
- **Rac.Rendering**: Delivers graphics capabilities including renderers, cameras, and vertex management
- **Rac.Audio**: Enables sound and music playback through service interfaces
- **Rac.Input**: Handles keyboard, mouse, and other input device management
- **Rac.Core**: Foundation utilities including window management and configuration systems

### ECS System Integration

The engine facade provides direct access to the ECS World and SystemScheduler, enabling applications to register custom systems and manage entities. The facade coordinates ECS updates within the main game loop timing, ensuring systems execute with proper delta time values and maintain frame-rate independence.

### Rendering System Integration

Rendering integration operates through the facade's renderer property and camera manager. The facade ensures camera matrices are updated before each render frame and coordinates the multi-phase rendering pipeline (clear, render, finalize) with application-specific rendering logic through the RenderEvent callback.

### Input System Integration

Input handling flows through the facade's event system, where low-level input events are transformed into application-friendly callbacks. The facade forwards keyboard events, mouse clicks, and scroll events while maintaining proper event timing and coordinate system consistency for screen-space operations.

### Audio System Integration

Audio integration uses the null object pattern to gracefully handle scenarios where audio capabilities are unavailable. The facade initializes audio services and provides consistent access regardless of underlying audio system availability, enabling applications to handle audio operations without complex conditional logic.

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Engine Setup

Applications typically start by constructing required subsystems (window manager, input service, configuration manager) and passing them to an engine facade implementation. The facade handles all internal wiring and coordination, requiring only system registration and event handler setup before calling Run() to start the main loop.

### ECS System Registration

Custom game systems are registered through the facade's AddSystem method, which delegates to the internal SystemScheduler. Systems receive proper delta time values during updates and can query the World through the facade's World property for entity and component access.

### Event-Driven Game Logic

Game logic integrates through the facade's event system, subscribing to LoadEvent for initialization, UpdateEvent for frame-based logic, RenderEvent for graphics operations, and input events for user interaction. This pattern enables clean separation between engine timing and application concerns.

### Service Access Patterns

Engine services are accessed through facade properties that provide direct references to initialized subsystems. Service access is consistent throughout the application lifetime, with all services guaranteed to be available after facade construction regardless of optional subsystem availability.

### Resource Loading and Management

Resource management operates through the integrated service interfaces, where the renderer handles graphics assets, audio service manages sound resources, and the window manager coordinates display resources. The facade ensures proper resource coordination and cleanup without requiring application-level resource tracking.

## Extension Points

### Custom Facade Implementations

The IEngineFacade interface supports custom implementations that can modify service resolution patterns, add diagnostic capabilities, or integrate with external frameworks. Custom facades can wrap or extend existing implementations while maintaining interface compatibility.

### Service Provider Integration

The ModularEngineFacade demonstrates integration with dependency injection patterns, enabling applications to use external service containers for complex dependency management. This extensibility supports integration with existing application architectures and testing frameworks.

### Event System Extensions

The event pipeline can be extended with additional event types or custom event routing logic. Applications can subscribe to existing events while custom facade implementations can introduce domain-specific events that integrate with the established event flow patterns.

### Advanced Subsystem Integration

Future enhancements may include additional subsystem integrations (networking, scripting, advanced audio), enhanced diagnostic capabilities, and performance monitoring integration. The current architecture provides clear extension points for these features without requiring fundamental design changes.
