Rac.Physics Project Documentation
Project Overview
The Rac.Physics project is a planned implementation for physics simulation systems within the RACEngine. This project is currently in the conceptual phase with placeholder interfaces and a null object implementation defining the intended physics capabilities for game development.
Planned Features

Comprehensive Physics Service: Complete physics simulation with rigid body dynamics, collision detection, and force application
Multiple Physics Body Types: Support for static boxes, dynamic spheres, capsules, and advanced geometric shapes
3D Physics Simulation: Full 3D physics with gravity, forces, impulses, and realistic collision responses
Advanced Collision Detection: Broadphase collision optimization and detailed collision filtering
Raycast Operations: Spatial queries for gameplay mechanics and AI systems

Current Implementation Status
⚠️ Mostly Not Implemented: All core physics classes contain placeholder code with TODO comments. Only the interface and null object pattern implementation are complete.
Implemented Components
IPhysicsService: Complete interface definition providing both simple and advanced physics functionality. Simple methods include Initialize, Update, body creation (AddStaticBox, AddDynamicSphere), and basic physics control. Advanced methods support detailed body configuration, force application, position/rotation queries, raycast operations, and collision filtering.
NullPhysicsService: Complete null object pattern implementation providing safe no-op physics functionality for testing and fallback scenarios. Implements complete IPhysicsService interface with harmless operations preventing crashes when physics simulation is disabled or unavailable.
Namespace Organization
Rac.Physics: Root namespace containing physics service interfaces and planned physics world implementations.
Rac.Physics.Collision: Reserved for collision detection systems including IBroadphase interface and AABBCheckBroadphase class for collision optimization.
Future Development
This project represents planned physics capabilities that will integrate with the ECS system to provide realistic physics simulation for game entities. Implementation will focus on performance-optimized algorithms suitable for real-time game scenarios, likely integrating with established physics libraries such as Bepu Physics or similar frameworks.
