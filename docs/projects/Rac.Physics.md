# Rac.Physics Project Documentation

## Project Overview

The Rac.Physics project implements a modular physics architecture that allows developers to compose custom physics solutions by selecting only the components they need. This implementation represents the Week 9-10 foundation from the design document, providing basic modules and a complete working physics system.

## Current Implementation Status

✅ **Fully Implemented - Week 9-10 Foundation**: All core components are complete with comprehensive educational documentation.

## Implemented Components

### Core Architecture
- **IPhysicsService**: Complete interface providing both simple and advanced physics functionality. Supports basic operations (Initialize, Update, body creation) and advanced features (force application, raycasting, collision filtering).
- **ModularPhysicsService**: Complete modular implementation that composes gravity, collision, and fluid modules into a unified physics system with proper physics pipeline execution.
- **IPhysicsWorld**: Physics world interface with thread-safe body management, O(1) entity lookups, and resource disposal.
- **PhysicsWorld**: Concrete implementation using ConcurrentDictionary for thread safety and efficient body management.
- **RigidBody**: Complete rigid body implementation with force accumulation, impulse handling, and AABB generation.

### Physics Modules (Week 9-10 Foundation)
- **NoGravityModule**: Perfect for top-down games and space environments where gravity is unwanted.
- **ConstantGravityModule**: Uniform gravitational field implementation (F = mg) with configurable gravity vector.

### Builder Pattern and Presets
- **PhysicsBuilder**: Fluent builder with validation for creating custom physics configurations.
- **PhysicsPresets**: Ready-to-use configurations:
  - `TopDown2D()`: Perfect for roguelike shooters (no gravity, AABB collision)
  - `Platformer2D()`: 2D games with gravity
  - `Headless()`: Testing and server scenarios
  - `Debug()`: Development with reduced gravity

### ECS Integration Components
- **RigidBodyComponent**: Core physics properties (mass, velocity, friction, restitution) with factory methods.
- **ColliderComponent**: Collision shape definition with 2D/3D box creation helpers and trigger support.
- **PhysicsMaterialComponent**: Surface properties with real-world material presets (Rubber, Ice, Metal, Wood).

### Educational Features
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Every class, method, and concept includes educational comments explaining physics principles, algorithms, and performance characteristics.
- **Physics Concepts**: F = ma, conservation of momentum, impulse vs force, collision response, spatial optimization theory.
- **Academic References**: References to classical mechanics, collision detection literature, and physics simulation methods.
- **Performance Analysis**: O(n) vs O(n²) complexity explanations, memory usage considerations, and scaling characteristics.

## API Examples

### Quick Start (Roguelike Shooter)
```csharp
// Create physics for top-down game
var physics = PhysicsPresets.TopDown2D();

// Add game objects
var playerId = physics.AddDynamicSphere(0, 0, 0, 0.5f, 1.0f);
var wallId = physics.AddStaticBox(-5, 0, 0, 1, 3, 1);

// Game loop
physics.Update(1.0f / 60.0f);

// Player movement
physics.ApplyForce(playerId, 10.0f, 0, 0);

// Bullet collision
bool hit = physics.Raycast(0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, out int hitId);
```

### Custom Configuration
```csharp
var customPhysics = PhysicsBuilder.Create()
    .WithGravity(GravityType.Constant, new Vector3D<float>(0, -9.81f, 0))
    .WithCollision(CollisionType.AABB)
    .WithFluid(FluidType.None)
    .Build();
```

## Performance Characteristics
