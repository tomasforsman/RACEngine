# Rac.GameEngine Project Documentation

## Project Overview

The `Rac.GameEngine` project provides a high-level game orchestration layer that coordinates application lifecycle, system integration, and game loop management for the RACEngine. This project serves as the primary entry point for game applications, abstracting the complexity of windowing, rendering, input handling, and ECS coordination into a cohesive, event-driven architecture.

### Key Design Principles

- **Complete Abstraction**: Hides windowing and rendering complexity behind clean, intuitive APIs
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Structured lifecycle events enable clean separation between engine and game logic
- **Configuration-Driven Setup**: Minimal boilerplate with sensible defaults for rapid development
- **Type-Safe Operations**: Strongly-typed vertex management and renderer interfaces prevent common errors
- **Resource Management**: Deterministic initialization and cleanup with graceful error handling
- **ECS Integration**: Seamless coordination with Entity-Component-System architecture for game logic

### Performance Characteristics

The GameEngine prioritizes frame-rate stability through buffered vertex management, efficient event propagation, and minimal allocation patterns. The system supports both immediate-mode rendering for simple scenarios and advanced rendering features for sophisticated graphics applications.

## Architecture Overview

The GameEngine follows a centralized orchestration pattern where the `Engine` class acts as the primary coordinator for all subsystems. The architecture emphasizes clear lifecycle phases, event-driven communication, and loose coupling between game logic and engine internals.

### Core Architectural Decisions

- **Single Engine Instance**: Centralized coordination through a single Engine object that manages all subsystems
- **Three-Phase Rendering**: Clear separation between game logic updates, rendering operations, and finalization
- **Event-Based Communication**: Application logic integrates through events rather than direct system coupling
- **Buffered Resource Management**: Vertex data and other resources can be prepared before full initialization
- **Typed Renderer Access**: Both simplified and advanced renderer interfaces available based on application needs

### Integration with ECS System and Other Engine Components

The GameEngine serves as the bridge between low-level engine systems and high-level game logic implemented through ECS. During each frame, the engine coordinates ECS system updates through the `OnEcsUpdate` event, ensuring proper timing and delta time propagation. The rendering phase integrates with the ECS through world transform queries and component-based rendering systems.

## Namespace Organization

### Rac.GameEngine

Contains the core `Engine` class that provides comprehensive application lifecycle management and system coordination.

**Engine**: Central game loop orchestrator that manages window lifecycle, rendering pipeline coordination, input event propagation, and ECS update timing. Provides both simple and advanced renderer interfaces, supports buffered vertex loading, and maintains clean separation between engine concerns and application logic. Features configuration-driven setup with automatic resource management and graceful cleanup.

### Rac.GameEngine.GameObject

Defines the foundation for game object abstractions within the engine ecosystem.

**IGameObject**: Marker interface establishing the contract for interactive game world elements. Serves as a foundation for future GameObject system architecture, providing a common type for all game entities that exist beyond the pure ECS data model. Reserved for game objects that require additional behavioral abstractions while maintaining ECS compatibility.

### Rac.GameEngine.Pooling

Provides object pooling system interfaces for performance optimization in resource-intensive scenarios.

**IPooling**: Contract for object pooling implementations that improve performance by reusing objects instead of constant allocation and destruction.

Designed to integrate with both ECS entities and traditional object-oriented game components.

### Rac.GameEngine.Prefab

Establishes prefab system architecture for reusable game object templates and configurations.

**IPrefab**: Interface for prefab objects that serve as reusable templates for creating game objects with predefined configurations. Enables efficient instantiation of complex game objects with predetermined component sets, properties, and hierarchical relationships. Designed to work seamlessly with ECS entity creation and component attachment workflows.

### Rac.GameEngine.Serialization

Defines serialization service contracts for game state persistence and data management.

**ISerialization**: Contract for serialization services that enable saving and loading of game state, including scene data, configuration settings, save files, and other persistent data. Provides abstraction over different serialization formats (JSON, binary, XML) while maintaining type safety and performance characteristics suitable for game development scenarios.

## Core Concepts and Workflows

### Game Loop Architecture

The GameEngine implements a structured three-phase game loop that separates concerns and provides predictable execution order:

1. **ECS Update Phase**: Game logic systems process entities, update components, and handle game state changes through the `OnEcsUpdate` event
2. **Rendering Phase**: Visual representation is updated through `OnRenderFrame` event, including vertex uploads, draw calls, and shader operations  
3. **Finalization Phase**: Frame completion, buffer swapping, and preparation for the next frame cycle

This architecture ensures consistent frame timing, proper resource synchronization, and clean separation between logic and presentation layers.

### Event System and Lifecycle Management

The event-driven architecture provides clear integration points for application code:

- **OnLoadEvent**: Fires once after complete initialization, enabling resource loading and initial game state setup
- **OnEcsUpdate**: Frame-based game logic updates with delta time for frame-rate independence
- **OnRenderFrame**: Rendering operations with access to both simple and advanced renderer interfaces
- **OnLeftClick** / **OnMouseScroll**: Input event propagation with appropriate coordinate transformations

### Vertex Management System

The GameEngine provides flexible vertex data management supporting multiple upload patterns:

- **Float Array Support**: Compatible with existing rendering code using raw float arrays
- **Typed Vertex Structures**: Type-safe vertex definitions with automatic layout detection
- **Buffered Loading**: Vertex data can be prepared before renderer initialization
- **Dynamic Updates**: Runtime vertex modifications with efficient buffer management

### Resource Management Workflow

Initialization and cleanup follow a deterministic pattern:

1. **Configuration Loading**: Engine reads configuration settings and applies window/rendering parameters
2. **System Initialization**: Windowing, OpenGL context, input services, and renderer setup
3. **Resource Loading**: Application-specific resources loaded through OnLoadEvent
4. **Runtime Operations**: Game loop execution with proper error handling and state management
5. **Graceful Shutdown**: Deterministic cleanup of all resources and system deinitialization

### Integration with ECS

The GameEngine coordinates with ECS through well-defined integration points:

- **System Registration**: ECS systems can be registered for automatic update coordination
- **Delta Time Propagation**: Consistent frame timing provided to all ECS systems
- **Transform Integration**: World transform data flows from ECS to rendering systems
- **Component Queries**: Rendering systems can query ECS for relevant entities and components

## Integration Points

### Engine Dependencies

- **Rac.Core.Manager**: Configuration management and core utility services
- **Rac.Input.Service**: Cross-platform input handling and event management  
- **Rac.Input.State**: Input state tracking and keyboard/mouse interaction
- **Rac.Rendering**: Complete rendering pipeline with shader management and vertex processing
- **Silk.NET Libraries**: Windowing, OpenGL context management, and mathematical operations

### Rendering System Integration

The GameEngine provides dual interfaces to the rendering system: a simplified `IRenderer` interface for basic operations and an advanced `OpenGLRenderer` interface for sophisticated graphics features. The rendering integration supports shader mode switching, post-processing effects, and direct OpenGL state management while maintaining automatic frame synchronization.

### Input System Integration

Input handling flows through the GameEngine's event system, providing cleaned and processed input data to application code. Mouse coordinates are provided in screen space with proper viewport consideration, and keyboard events include key state tracking with appropriate debouncing and repeat handling.

### Audio System Integration

Through the broader engine architecture, the GameEngine coordinates with audio systems for 3D spatial audio that responds to ECS transform data and scene hierarchy changes. Audio events can be triggered through the same event system used for rendering and input.

### Asset Management Integration

The GameEngine coordinates with asset loading systems to ensure proper timing of resource initialization relative to OpenGL context creation and other system dependencies. Asset loading can be deferred until the OnLoadEvent to guarantee full system readiness.

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Engine Setup

Typical engine initialization involves creating an Engine instance, registering event handlers for game logic, and initiating the game loop. The configuration system allows customization of window properties, rendering settings, and other engine parameters through external configuration files or programmatic setup.

### ECS Integration Workflow

Applications using ECS architecture register systems with the engine, implement game logic through component updates during OnEcsUpdate events, and handle rendering through component queries during OnRenderFrame events. The engine manages system execution order and provides consistent delta timing for frame-rate independence.

### Rendering Implementation Patterns

Simple rendering uses the IRenderer interface with basic vertex upload and draw operations. Advanced scenarios leverage the OpenGLRenderer interface for shader management, post-processing effects, and direct OpenGL state manipulation. Both patterns support efficient vertex buffer management and automatic state synchronization.

### Input Handling Workflows

Input events are processed through engine event handlers that provide cleaned coordinate data and appropriate state information. Applications can implement click handling, keyboard shortcuts, and mouse interaction through the provided event interfaces without directly managing input system complexity.

### Resource Loading and Management

Resource initialization should occur during the OnLoadEvent to ensure all engine systems are fully initialized. Runtime resource updates can occur during the game loop, with the engine providing appropriate synchronization and error handling for resource state changes.

### Performance Optimization Patterns

High-performance applications should minimize event handler complexity, batch vertex updates when possible, and leverage the engine's buffered resource management. The engine supports efficient frame-rate monitoring and provides timing information for application-level performance optimization.

## Extension Points

### Custom System Integration

The GameEngine architecture supports integration of additional engine systems through the event system and dependency injection patterns. New systems can register for lifecycle events and coordinate with existing engine infrastructure while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

### Enhanced Rendering Features

The dual-interface rendering architecture enables both simple applications and sophisticated graphics implementations. Future rendering enhancements can be added through the advanced renderer interface while maintaining backward compatibility with simple rendering patterns.

### Input System Extensions

Additional input devices and interaction patterns can be integrated through the existing input service architecture. The event system can be extended to support new input types while maintaining consistent API patterns and coordinate system handling.

### Serialization and Persistence

The serialization interface provides extensibility for different data formats and persistence strategies. Future implementations can support binary serialization, JSON persistence, cloud save integration, and other data management patterns while maintaining type safety and performance characteristics.

### Asset Pipeline Integration

Future asset management enhancements can integrate with the engine's resource loading patterns to support advanced asset streaming, hot-reloading during development, and optimized asset bundling for distribution builds.

### Debugging and Development Tools

The engine architecture supports integration of debugging interfaces, performance profilers, and development tools through the event system and system coordination patterns. These tools can access engine state and coordinate with game logic without requiring engine core modifications.
