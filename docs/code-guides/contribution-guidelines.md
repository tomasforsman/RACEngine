#### Key Architectural Concepts
- **ECS Architecture**: Entity-Component-System pattern with data-oriented design
- **4-Phase Rendering**: Configuration → Preprocessing → Processing → Post-processing
- **Educational Focus**: Code includes educational comments and academic references
- **Modular Design**: Each subsystem is independently testable and replaceable

## Development Workflow

### 1. Planning Your Contribution

#### Before You Start
1. **Check existing work**: Search issues and pull requests
2. **Discuss major changes**: Open an issue for significant features
3. **Review documentation**: Read relevant architecture and code guides
4. **Understand requirements**: Ensure your contribution fits project goals

#### Creating an Issue
```markdown
### Description
Clear description of the problem or feature request

### Context
Why is this needed? How does it fit with project goals?

### Proposed Solution
Your suggested approach (for features)

### Additional Context
Screenshots, code examples, or references
```

### 2. Development Process

#### Branch Strategy
```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# For bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description

# For documentation
git checkout -b docs/area-being-documented
```

```

#### Code Quality Standards

##### Educational Code Requirements
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Implements Craig Reynolds' Boids flocking algorithm (1987)
/// Educational note: Demonstrates emergent behavior from simple rules
/// Academic reference: "Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model"
/// </summary>
public class BoidsSystem : ISystem
{
    // ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    // FLOCKING BEHAVIOR IMPLEMENTATION
    // ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Calculates separation force to avoid crowding neighbors
    /// Educational note: Maintains minimum distance between entities
    /// </summary>
    private Vector2 CalculateSeparation(Entity entity, IEnumerable<Entity> neighbors)
    {
        // Implementation with educational comments...
    }
}
```

##### Performance Considerations
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Spatial hash grid for efficient neighbor queries
/// Educational note: Reduces collision detection from O(n²) to O(n)
/// Performance: ~10x faster for 1000+ entities
/// </summary>
public class SpatialHashGrid
{
    // Implementation focusing on cache-friendly data structures
    // and minimal allocations in hot paths
}
```

### 3. Testing Your Changes

#### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run specific test project
dotnet test tests/Rac.Core.Tests/

# Run with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Run performance tests
dotnet test tests/Rac.Performance.Tests/ --configuration Release
```

#### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test sample games
cd samples/SampleGame
dotnet run -- boidsample
dotnet run -- shootersample
dotnet run -- bloomtest

# Test your specific changes
# Verify performance hasn't regressed
# Check visual quality and correctness
```

#### Test Requirements
- All existing tests must pass
- New features require comprehensive test coverage
- Integration tests for cross-module functionality
- Performance tests for optimization work

### 4. Documentation Updates

#### Required Documentation
- **XML comments**: All public APIs must have comprehensive documentation
- **Architecture docs**: Update if your changes affect system design
- **User guides**: Update if user-facing functionality changes
- **Educational material**: Add learning content for complex features

#### Documentation Standards
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Manages the 4-phase rendering pipeline for optimal GPU performance.
/// Educational note: Separating phases reduces state changes and improves batching.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The 4-phase approach provides several benefits:
/// 1. Configuration phase allows batching of state changes
/// 2. Preprocessing enables culling and optimization
/// 3. Processing minimizes GPU state transitions
/// 4. Post-processing applies effects without affecting main rendering
/// 
/// This design pattern is used in commercial engines like Unreal and Unity.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// <code>
/// var pipeline = new RenderPipeline(renderer);
/// pipeline.Configure(shaderManager, camera);
/// pipeline.Preprocess(renderables);
/// pipeline.Process();
/// pipeline.PostProcess();
/// </code>
/// </example>
public class RenderPipeline
{
    // Implementation...
}
```
