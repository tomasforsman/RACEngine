### Architecture
Contains diagrams and documents pertaining to the architecture of the game engine, including system interactions, data flow, and design patterns.

### copilot
Contains compact documentation suitable for AI agents like Copilot, focusing on code snippets and usage examples.
This documentation has the purpose of assisting AI agents in understanding and generating code by:
a) Guide AI agents in where to find relevant code for the issues they are wokring on.
b) Provide AI agents with the context they need to understand how the code works.
c) Speeding up the process of finding relevant code and avoiding having to discover what is not yet implemented each time.
d) Making sure that AI agents don't reinvent the wheel by providing them with existing solutions and patterns.
