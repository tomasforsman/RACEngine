This is a design plan before implementing Rac.Assets and are subject to change and should not be viewed as a 'truth' about the project.

## Rac.Assets Architecture Overview

### Core Design Principles
- **Asynchronous-First**: All asset loading operations designed for async/await patterns
- **Educational Transparency**: Clear documentation of asset pipeline stages and performance implications
- **Hot-Reload Support**: Development-time asset updates without restart
- **Type-Safe Asset References**: Strongly-typed asset handles preventing runtime errors
- **Dependency Management**: Automatic tracking and resolution of asset dependencies
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reference counting, pooling, and streaming for optimal memory usage

## Namespace Organization
