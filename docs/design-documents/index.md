# Design Documents

Detailed design documentation for RACEngine systems and features.

## 📋 System Design Documents

### Physics System
- [Rac.Physics Design Document](Rac.Phyiscs.DesignDoc.md) - Comprehensive physics system design and implementation plan

## 🎯 Quick Navigation

**System Design:**
→ [Rac.Physics Design Document](Rac.Phyiscs.DesignDoc.md) for physics system architecture

## 📚 Related Documentation

- [Architecture Documentation](../architecture/) - High-level system architecture
- [Project Documentation](../projects/) - Module-specific implementation details
- [Code Guides](../code-guides/) - Development standards and patterns

## 📝 Design Document Purpose

Design documents serve multiple purposes in RACEngine development:

- **Planning**: Detailed planning before implementation
- **Communication**: Sharing design decisions with contributors
- **Documentation**: Recording design rationale and decisions
- **Reference**: Ongoing reference during development and maintenance

## 🔧 Design Document Structure

Each design document typically includes:

- **Overview**: High-level description and goals
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Architecture**: System design and component relationships
- **Implementation**: Detailed implementation approach
- **Testing**: Testing strategy and validation criteria
- **Performance**: Performance considerations and optimization
- **Future Work**: Planned enhancements and extensions

## 🔄 Design Process

1. **Identify Need**: Recognize need for new system or major changes
2. **Research**: Investigate existing solutions and best practices
3. **Design**: Create detailed design document
4. **Review**: Community review and feedback
5. **Implement**: Development following design specifications
6. **Update**: Maintain design documents as systems evolve

Design documents are living documents that evolve with the codebase while preserving the original design rationale and decisions.
