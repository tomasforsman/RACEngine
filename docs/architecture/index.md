# Architecture Documentation

Deep dive into RACEngine's system design and architectural decisions.

## ðŸ“‹ Architecture Guides

### Core Architecture
- [System Overview](system-overview.md) - High-level architecture overview and module relationships
- [ECS Architecture](ecs-architecture.md) - Entity-Component-System design patterns and implementation
- [Rendering Pipeline](rendering-pipeline.md) - 4-phase rendering system architecture

### System-Specific Architecture
- [Audio Architecture](audio-architecture.md) - Audio system integration and design
- [System Exposure Architecture Patterns](system-exposure-architecture-patterns.md) - How systems expose functionality

### Design Documentation
- [Dependency Diagram](dependency-diagram.md) - Visual representation of module dependencies

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Navigation

**Getting Started with Architecture:**
â†’ Start with [System Overview](system-overview.md) for the big picture
â†’ Then explore [ECS Architecture](ecs-architecture.md) for component patterns
â†’ Finally dive into [Rendering Pipeline](rendering-pipeline.md) for graphics understanding

**For Engine Contributors:**
â†’ Review [System Exposure Architecture Patterns](system-exposure-architecture-patterns.md) for API design
â†’ Check [Dependency Diagram](dependency-diagram.md) for module relationships

**For System Integration:**
â†’ [Audio Architecture](audio-architecture.md) for audio system integration
