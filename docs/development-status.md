# Development Status Summary

This document provides a quick overview of RACEngine implementation status and points to detailed documentation.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Well Implemented
- **Core ECS System** - Entity Component System with comprehensive architecture
- **Configuration Management** - Robust configuration system with builders
- **Asset Management** - File system and asset loading with builder pattern
- **Rendering Pipeline** - Basic OpenGL renderer with multi-phase architecture
- **Audio System** - Basic audio mixer and service implementation
- **Input System** - Input service with null object pattern
- **Dependency Injection** - Consistent DI patterns throughout

### ⚠️ Basic Implementation (Needs Enhancement)
- **Physics System** - Basic physics with many advanced features marked as NotImplementedException
- **Camera System** - Basic camera functionality, could expand with advanced controllers
- **Shader System** - Structure exists but needs shader effects and hot-reload
- **Project Tools** - GUI application framework exists (Avalonia-based)

### ❌ Not Implemented (Complete Stubs)
- **Tools Module** - Build pipeline, shader editor, level editor (all TODO stubs)
- **Animation Module** - Skeletal animation, blend trees (all TODO stubs)
- **AI Module** - Behavior trees, pathfinding (all TODO stubs)
- **Networking Module** - All networking functionality (all TODO stubs)
- **Scripting Module** - Lua and C# scripting engines (all TODO stubs)
- **Advanced Rendering** - Particle systems, advanced shaders, text rendering

## Quick Statistics

- **Total Files with TODO/NotImplementedException**: 35
- **Complete Stub Classes**: ~25
- **Modules with Partial Implementation**: 8
- **Modules Fully Stubbed**: 5

## For Detailed Analysis

See [Not Implemented Features](development/not-implemented-features.md) for:
- Complete categorized list of missing functionality
- Priority recommendations for implementation
- Enhancement opportunities for existing code
- Educational value assessment

## For Contributors

The codebase provides excellent learning opportunities with:
- **Clear Architecture** - Well-documented design patterns
- **Educational Comments** - Extensive explanations of concepts
- **Progressive Complexity** - Multiple access layers for different skill levels
- **Consistent Patterns** - Builder pattern, null object pattern, dependency injection

Students and contributors can choose implementation tasks based on:
- **Skill Level** - From basic stubs to complex system enhancements  
- **Interest Area** - Graphics, AI, networking, tools, etc.
- **Time Commitment** - From simple features to major subsystems
