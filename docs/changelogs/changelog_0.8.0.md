# Changelog 0.8.0 - UV Debugging & Texture Coordinate Systems

Released: June 25, 2025

This release introduces powerful visual debugging tools for texture coordinates and resolves several critical issues with UV coordinate systems in procedural effects and texture mapping.

## Added Features

### Visual Debugging System
* **DebugUV Feature**: Real-time visualization of texture coordinates as colored overlays
* **Shader Integration**: Seamless integration with existing shader pipeline
* **Fallback Mechanisms**: Robust fallback when DebugUV shaders fail to compile
* **Enhanced Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for debugging features

### Geometry Generation
* **GeometryGenerators Utility**: Procedural geometry generation with proper UV mapping
* **RenderingPipelineDemo**: Updated sample showcasing geometry generation and UV debugging
* **Educational Examples**: Clear demonstrations of UV coordinate calculation methods

## Bug Fixes

### Critical Texture Coordinate Issues
* **Procedural Effects Fix**: Restored original centered UV coordinate system for distance-based effects
* **Texture Misalignment**: Fixed texture coordinate calculation for proper texture sampling
* **Coordinate System Consistency**: Ensured UV coordinates remain consistent regardless of transformations

### Root Cause Analysis
The texture misalignment issues were caused by inconsistent UV coordinate calculation methods:
- **Problem**: UV coordinates were being calculated from final transformed positions rather than original local positions
- **Solution**: Calculate UV coordinates from original local vertex positions before any transformations
- **Impact**: This ensures texture coordinates remain stable regardless of object rotation, translation, or scaling

### Shader Debugging Improvements
* **Error Reporting**: Enhanced shader compilation error reporting with detailed diagnostics
* **Blending Configuration**: Improved blending configuration for debug visualizations
* **Coordinate Conversion**: Proper conversion between centered coordinates and [0,1] range for visualization

## Technical Details

### UV Coordinate Systems
Two distinct coordinate systems are now properly supported:
1. **Procedural Effects**: Centered at (0,0) for distance-based calculations: `U = (localX - centerX) / rangeX`
2. **Texture Sampling**: Standard [0,1] range: `U = (localX - minX) / (maxX - minX)`

### DebugUV Implementation
- Fragment shader overlay showing UV coordinates as colors
- Red channel represents U coordinate, Green channel represents V coordinate
- Automatic fallback to standard rendering when debug shaders fail
- Toggle support for runtime debugging

## Improvements

### Documentation Enhancements
* **UV Mapping Guidelines**: Comprehensive documentation of coordinate system choices
* **Shader Documentation**: Detailed explanation of debug visualization techniques
* **Educational Comments**: Enhanced code comments explaining graphics concepts

### Testing Infrastructure
* **Comprehensive Tests**: Full test coverage for DebugUV functionality
* **Example Integration**: Working examples in samples demonstrating proper usage
* **Validation**: Automated validation of coordinate system consistency

## Educational Impact

This release significantly enhances understanding of:
- Texture coordinate systems and their applications
- Visual debugging techniques for graphics programming
- Procedural geometry generation and UV mapping
- Shader pipeline integration and error handling

## Performance Notes

- DebugUV visualization has minimal performance impact when disabled
- Geometry generation utilities are optimized for runtime usage
- UV coordinate calculations use efficient algorithms avoiding redundant transformations
