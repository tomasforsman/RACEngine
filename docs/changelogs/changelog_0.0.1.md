# Changelog 0.1.0 - Initial Foundation

## Overview

This initial release establishes the foundational structure and architectural principles for RACEngine, setting up the modular project organization and core infrastructure that will support all future development.

## 🎯 Project Establishment

### Repository and Structure
* **Modular Project Architecture**: Established separate project structure for each major subsystem
* **Solution Organization**: Created comprehensive .NET solution with proper dependency management
* **Version Control**: Git repository initialization with appropriate .gitignore and configuration
* **Cross-Platform Foundation**: .NET 8 targeting for Windows, Linux, and macOS support

### Core Infrastructure
* **Build System**: MSBuild configuration with NuGet package management
* **Project Templates**: Consistent project file structure across all modules
* **Global Configuration**: Shared global.json and .editorconfig for consistent development
* **Testing Framework**: Foundation for comprehensive unit testing across all modules

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Modular Design Philosophy
* **Separation of Concerns**: Each major feature area gets its own dedicated project
* **Dependency Management**: Clear dependency chains with interfaces for decoupling
* **Educational Focus**: Commitment to code clarity and educational value over performance shortcuts
* **Null Object Pattern**: Design decision to include null implementations for optional services
