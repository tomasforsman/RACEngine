# Changelog 0.10.0 - Documentation & Architecture Refinement

Released: June 26, 2025

This release focuses on establishing comprehensive documentation standards and refining the overall architecture documentation. The goal was to make RACEngine more accessible to developers and provide clear guidance on engine concepts.

## Added Features

### Comprehensive Documentation System
* **XML Documentation Standards**: Complete guide for documenting public APIs with educational value
* **Architecture Documentation**: Detailed system overview covering ECS, rendering pipeline, and core concepts
* **Installation Guide**: Step-by-step setup instructions for all supported platforms
* **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions with debug information collection
* **Contribution Guidelines**: Complete workflow for contributors including code style and review process

### Educational Material
* **Code Style Guidelines**: Comprehensive style guide with RACEngine-specific patterns
* **Getting Started Tutorial**: Hands-on introduction to engine concepts and usage
* **Project Documentation**: Detailed documentation for each engine module (Rac.Core, Rac.Audio, etc.)
* **Copilot Instructions**: AI-assisted development guidelines for consistent code generation

## Improvements

### Documentation Infrastructure
* **Template System**: Standardized documentation templates for consistency
* **Cross-References**: Improved linking between related documentation sections
* **Code Examples**: Practical examples throughout documentation with working code
* **Educational Comments**: Enhanced in-code documentation explaining complex algorithms

### Project Organization
* **Documentation Structure**: Organized docs into logical categories (code-guides, user-guides, etc.)
* **Metadata Standards**: Consistent frontmatter and versioning for all documentation
* **Maintenance Guidelines**: Process for keeping documentation current with code changes

## Technical Details

### Documentation Features
- XML documentation for all public APIs with comprehensive examples
- Educational comments explaining graphics concepts and game engine theory
- Reference to academic papers and industry standards where applicable
- Performance considerations and optimization notes documented
- Thread-safety guarantees explicitly documented

### Architectural Improvements
- Clear separation between educational content and technical reference
- Improved organization of engine modules and their responsibilities
- Better integration between documentation and actual codebase
- Standardized naming conventions and coding patterns documented

## Educational Impact

This release significantly enhances the educational value of RACEngine by:
- Providing clear learning paths for game engine development
- Explaining complex graphics and engine concepts with practical examples
- Offering comprehensive guides for different skill levels
- Establishing patterns that teach good software architecture practices

## Migration Notes

No breaking changes in this release. All improvements are additive and enhance the existing engine without affecting functionality.
