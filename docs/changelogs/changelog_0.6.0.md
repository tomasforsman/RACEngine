# Changelog 0.6.0 - Camera System & Multi-Pass Rendering

Released: June 18, 2025

This release introduces a sophisticated camera system with dual-camera rendering capabilities, mouse scroll zoom support, and comprehensive integration across all sample applications. Multiple critical rendering issues were also resolved.

## Added Features

### Advanced Camera System
* **Dual-Camera Rendering**: Support for multiple cameras with independent viewports and transformations
* **Multi-Pass Rendering**: Efficient rendering pipeline supporting multiple camera perspectives
* **Camera Integration**: Seamless integration with existing rendering systems
* **Viewport Management**: Independent viewport configuration for each camera

### Enhanced Input Support
* **Mouse Scroll Zoom**: Universal zoom support across all sample applications
* **Camera Controls**: Intuitive camera manipulation with mouse and keyboard
* **Input Conflict Resolution**: Improved input handling to prevent conflicts between different systems

### Sample Application Updates
* **BoidSample Integration**: Dual-camera rendering showcasing different perspectives of boid simulation
* **BloomTest Integration**: Camera system integration with post-processing effects
* **ShooterSample Integration**: Camera system enhancing gameplay experience
* **Grid Rendering**: Improved grid visibility and rendering across all samples

## Bug Fixes

### Critical Rendering Issues
* **Bloom Effect Compatibility**: Fixed bloom effect incompatibility with camera transformations
  - **Root Cause**: Camera matrix transformations were interfering with post-processing coordinate calculations
  - **Solution**: Separated camera transformations from post-processing coordinate systems
  - **Impact**: Bloom effects now work correctly regardless of camera position and orientation

* **Shader Compilation Crashes**: Fixed Unicode character issues causing shader compilation failures
  - **Root Cause**: Unicode characters in shader source code were causing compilation errors
  - **Solution**: Implemented proper encoding handling and character validation for shader source
  - **Impact**: Eliminated random crashes during shader compilation and improved reliability

* **Grid Rendering Issues**: Resolved grid visibility and rendering problems
  - **Root Cause**: Grid rendering was not properly accounting for camera transformations
  - **Solution**: Updated grid rendering to use camera-aware coordinate calculations
  - **Impact**: Grid now renders correctly in all camera positions and zoom levels

### Input System Improvements
* **Input Conflicts**: Fixed conflicts between different input handlers in samples
  - **Root Cause**: Multiple systems were competing for the same input events
  - **Solution**: Implemented proper input prioritization and event handling chains
  - **Impact**: Smooth, conflict-free input handling across all applications

## Technical Details

### Camera Architecture
The camera system is built on several key components:
- **Camera Component**: Stores camera properties (position, orientation, projection)
- **Viewport Management**: Handles screen-space to world-space transformations
- **Rendering Integration**: Seamless integration with existing rendering pipeline
- **Multi-Camera Support**: Efficient rendering of multiple camera perspectives

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient matrix calculations for camera transformations
- Optimized viewport operations for multiple cameras
- Reduced redundant transformations in multi-pass rendering
- Improved memory usage for camera-related data structures

## Improvements

### Sample Quality
* **Enhanced Examples**: All samples now demonstrate camera system capabilities
* **Educational Value**: Clear examples of camera usage patterns and best practices
* **Visual Improvements**: Better visual presentation with improved grid and zoom support
* **User Experience**: More intuitive interaction with mouse scroll zoom

### Code Quality
* **Refactoring**: Improved code organization for camera-related functionality
* **Documentation**: Enhanced documentation for camera system usage
* **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of camera transformations and rendering
* **Error Handling**: Better error handling for camera-related operations

## Educational Impact

This release introduces important computer graphics concepts:
- Camera mathematics and transformations
- Viewport and projection calculations
- Multi-pass rendering techniques
- Input handling in interactive graphics applications

The dual-camera system provides excellent learning opportunities for understanding:
- 3D coordinate systems and transformations
- Camera positioning and orientation
- Rendering pipeline integration
