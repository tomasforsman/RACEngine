        // Implements three fundamental flocking behaviors:
        // 1. Separation - avoid crowding neighbors
        // 2. Alignment - steer towards average heading of neighbors  
        // 3. Cohesion - steer towards average position of neighbors
        
        foreach (var entity in world.EntitiesWith<BoidComponent, PositionComponent, VelocityComponent>())
        {
            var (boid, position, velocity) = world.GetComponents<BoidComponent, PositionComponent, VelocityComponent>(entity);
            
            var separation = CalculateSeparation(world, entity, position);
