namespace Rac.AI.BehaviorTree;

/// <summary>
/// Defines the contract for behavior tree systems that provide hierarchical AI decision making.
/// Enables sophisticated AI behaviors through composable nodes and conditional logic.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Behavior trees are a powerful AI pattern that provides:
/// - Hierarchical decision making through tree structures
/// - Reusable behavior components and composable logic
/// - Visual editing and debugging capabilities
/// - Dynamic behavior modification at runtime
/// - Scalable AI complexity from simple NPCs to complex agents
/// 
/// Educational Note: Behavior trees are widely used in game AI because they:
/// - Provide clear, visual representation of AI logic
/// - Enable non-programmers to create and modify AI behaviors
/// - Support complex decision making without deep nesting
/// - Allow for dynamic behavior switching based on game state
/// - Facilitate debugging and testing of AI systems
/// 
/// Common Node Types:
/// - Composite Nodes: Sequence, Selector, Parallel execution
/// - Decorator Nodes: Invert, Repeat, Cooldown, Condition checking
/// - Leaf Nodes: Actions, Conditions, specific behaviors
/// - Reference Nodes: Sub-trees and behavior reuse
/// 
/// Behavior Tree Patterns:
/// - Guard patterns: Check conditions before executing actions
/// - Fallback chains: Try preferred actions, fall back to alternatives
/// - Parallel execution: Multiple behaviors running simultaneously
/// - State monitoring: React to world state changes
/// 
/// Implementation Status: This interface is currently a placeholder and will be
/// implemented with comprehensive behavior tree functionality in future development.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// <code>
/// // Future usage example:
/// var enemyAI = new BehaviorTree()
///     .Sequence()
///         .Condition("PlayerInRange")
///         .Selector()
///             .Sequence()
///                 .Condition("HasAmmo")
///                 .Action("ShootAtPlayer")
///             .Action("MoveToPlayer")
///     .Build();
/// 
/// enemyAI.Execute(deltaTime);
/// </code>
/// </example>

    // TODO: implement IBehaviorTree
    // Future functionality will include:
    // - Node composition and tree building
    // - Execution context and state management
    // - Conditional evaluation and action execution
    // - Runtime behavior modification and debugging
    // - Performance optimization for multiple AI agents
