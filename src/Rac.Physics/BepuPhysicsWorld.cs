/// <remarks>
/// Educational Note: BepuPhysics is a modern, high-performance physics engine
/// designed for games and simulations. This wrapper class will eventually provide
/// RACEngine-specific integration while maintaining the performance benefits of BepuPhysics.
/// 
/// Current Status: This is a placeholder implementation. Full integration with BepuPhysics
/// is planned for future releases to provide:
/// - Rigid body dynamics
/// - Collision detection and response
/// - Constraint systems
/// - Broad-phase and narrow-phase collision detection
/// </remarks>
