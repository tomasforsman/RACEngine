/// <summary>
/// Implements broadphase collision detection using Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) overlap testing.
/// This is a simple but effective broadphase algorithm suitable for small to medium numbers of objects.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Educational Note: AABB Broadphase Algorithm
/// 
/// This implementation uses Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) to perform initial collision filtering.
/// AABBs are rectangular boxes aligned with the coordinate axes, making overlap testing very fast
/// using simple min/max comparisons.
/// 
/// Algorithm Steps:
/// 1. Each physics object gets an AABB that fully contains its geometry
/// 2. For each pair of objects, test if their AABBs overlap
/// 3. Only objects with overlapping AABBs need detailed collision testing
/// 
/// Advantages:
/// - Very fast overlap testing (6 floating-point comparisons)
/// - Simple to implement and understand
/// - Works well for objects of similar sizes
/// 
/// Disadvantages:
/// - O(nÂ²) complexity for n objects
/// - Less efficient for scenes with many objects
/// - Doesn't handle highly elongated objects efficiently
/// 
/// For larger scenes, consider spatial partitioning algorithms like octrees or sweep-and-prune.
/// </remarks>
