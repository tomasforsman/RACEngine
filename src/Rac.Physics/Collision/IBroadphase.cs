/// <summary>
/// Interface for broadphase collision detection algorithms in the physics engine.
/// Broadphase collision detection efficiently eliminates pairs of objects that cannot possibly be colliding.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Educational Note: Broadphase Collision Detection
/// 
/// Broadphase is the first stage of collision detection in physics engines, designed to quickly
/// eliminate object pairs that are clearly not colliding. This dramatically reduces the number
/// of expensive narrow-phase collision tests needed.
/// 
/// Common broadphase algorithms include:
/// - Spatial Hashing: Divides space into grid cells
/// - Sweep and Prune: Sorts objects along axes to find overlaps
/// - Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH): Tree structures for spatial organization
/// - Quadtrees/Octrees: Recursive spatial subdivision
/// 
/// The broadphase should return potential collision pairs, which are then passed to
/// narrow-phase algorithms for detailed collision testing.
/// </remarks>
