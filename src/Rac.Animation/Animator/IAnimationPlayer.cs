namespace Rac.Animation.Animator;

/// <summary>
/// Defines the contract for animation playback systems that control sprite and skeletal animations.
/// Provides timeline-based animation control with support for transitions, blending, and events.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The IAnimationPlayer interface enables sophisticated animation systems by providing:
/// - Timeline-based animation playback with precise frame control
/// - Smooth transitions between different animation states
/// - Animation blending for natural movement combinations
/// - Event-driven animation callbacks for gameplay integration
/// - Support for both sprite-based and skeletal animation systems
/// 
/// Educational Note: Game animation systems require careful timing and state management:
/// - Frame-rate independence ensures consistent animation speed
/// - State machines manage complex animation transitions
/// - Blending enables smooth character movement and actions
/// - Events synchronize gameplay with animation milestones
/// 
/// Common Animation Patterns:
/// - State-based transitions: Walking → Running → Jumping
/// - Layered animations: Upper body actions while walking
/// - Procedural blending: Mix multiple animations based on game state
/// - Timeline events: Trigger effects at specific animation frames
/// 
/// Implementation Status: This interface is currently a placeholder and will be
/// implemented with comprehensive animation functionality in future development.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// <code>
/// // Future usage example:
/// var player = new AnimationPlayer();
/// player.PlayAnimation("Walk", loop: true);
/// player.TransitionTo("Run", duration: 0.3f);
/// player.OnAnimationEvent += (eventName) => {
///     if (eventName == "FootStep") PlayFootstepSound();
/// };
/// </code>
/// </example>
public interface IAnimationPlayer
{
    // TODO: implement IAnimationPlayer
    // Future functionality will include:
    // - Animation playback control (play, pause, stop, loop)
    // - Transition management with customizable blending
    // - Timeline event handling and callback systems
    // - Multi-layer animation support for complex characters
    // - Performance optimization for large numbers of animated entities
