namespace Rac.ECS.Entities;

/// <summary>
/// Defines the contract for entities within the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture.
/// Represents a unique identifier that can have components attached to define behavior and data.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// In ECS architecture, entities are lightweight identifiers that serve as containers for components.
/// They don't contain logic or data themselves, but act as unique keys that link related components
/// together. This pattern promotes composition over inheritance and enables highly flexible game object design.
/// 
/// Educational Note: ECS is a popular architectural pattern in game engines because it:
/// - Separates data (Components) from behavior (Systems)
/// - Enables efficient batch processing of similar components
/// - Provides flexible composition without deep inheritance hierarchies
/// - Facilitates data-oriented design for better performance
/// 
/// The Entity serves as the "E" in ECS, providing the organizational structure that ties
/// components together into coherent game objects like players, enemies, or environmental elements.
/// 
/// Implementation Status: This interface is currently a placeholder and will be expanded
/// to include entity lifecycle management, component attachment, and unique identification
/// in future development iterations.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// <code>
/// // Future usage example showing entity composition:
/// // Create an entity for a player character
/// // var player = world.CreateEntity();
/// 
/// // Add components to define the player's properties and behavior
/// // player.Add&lt;TransformComponent&gt;(new TransformComponent { Position = Vector3.Zero });
/// // player.Add&lt;HealthComponent&gt;(new HealthComponent { MaxHealth = 100, CurrentHealth = 100 });
/// // player.Add&lt;InputComponent&gt;(new InputComponent());
/// 
/// // The entity now represents a player with position, health, and input capabilities
/// // Systems will process entities based on their component combinations
/// </code>
/// </example>
public interface IEntity
{
    // TODO: implement IEntity
    // Future functionality will include:
    // - Unique entity ID management
    // - Component attachment and removal
    // - Entity lifecycle (creation, destruction)
    // - Component queries and access
    // - Entity relationships and hierarchies
