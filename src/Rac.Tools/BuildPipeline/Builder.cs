namespace Rac.Tools.BuildPipeline;

/// <summary>
/// Provides build pipeline functionality for RACEngine project compilation and packaging.
/// Automates the build process for games and applications using the engine.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The Builder class will implement build automation features including:
/// - Project compilation and dependency resolution
/// - Asset processing and optimization
/// - Platform-specific packaging and deployment
/// - Build configuration management
/// - Automated testing and validation
/// 
/// Educational Note: Build pipelines are essential for game development as they:
/// - Automate repetitive compilation tasks
/// - Ensure consistent builds across development environments
/// - Optimize assets for target platforms
/// - Enable continuous integration and deployment
/// 
/// Implementation Status: This class is currently a placeholder and will be
/// implemented in future engine development phases.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// <code>
/// // Future usage example:
/// var builder = new Builder();
/// builder.SetConfiguration("Release");
/// builder.SetPlatform("Windows");
/// builder.Build("MyGame.csproj");
/// </code>
/// </example>
public class Builder
{
    // TODO: implement Builder

    // - Project file parsing and dependency analysis
    // - Asset pipeline integration
    // - Platform-specific build configurations
    // - Output packaging and distribution
