/// <summary>
/// Null Object pattern implementation of IInputService for testing, headless execution, and safe fallback scenarios.
/// Provides complete input service API compatibility with no-operation implementations that prevent input-related errors.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The NullInputService implements the Null Object pattern for input handling, providing the same benefits
/// as other null object implementations in RACEngine while addressing input-specific concerns:
/// 
/// **Educational Value - Input System Architecture:**
/// - Demonstrates safe input handling in headless environments
/// - Shows how to maintain interface compliance without hardware dependencies
/// - Illustrates input abstraction for cross-platform compatibility
/// - Provides foundation for input recording and playback systems
/// 
/// **Use Cases:**
/// - **Headless Testing**: Unit tests that don't require user interaction
/// - **Server Applications**: Game servers without input requirements
/// - **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipelines running without input devices
/// - **Input Recording**: Playback systems that replace real input with recorded data
/// - **Fallback Safety**: When input system initialization fails
/// 
/// **Input State Management:**
/// - **Empty State Objects**: Provides valid but empty keyboard state instances
/// - **No Event Firing**: Events are declared but never invoked
/// - **Safe Property Access**: All properties return valid, empty state objects
/// - **Consistent Interface**: All methods accept parameters without error
/// 
/// **Testing Benefits:**
/// - **Deterministic Behavior**: No random user input affects test outcomes
/// - **Performance**: No input polling overhead during automated testing
/// - **Isolation**: Game logic can be tested independently of input handling
/// - **Simulation**: Specific input scenarios can be simulated through direct calls
/// 
/// **Development Workflow:**
/// - **Debug Builds**: Warning message alerts developers to null input usage
/// - **Server Builds**: Silent operation for production server environments
/// - **Tool Development**: Command-line tools don't need input system initialization
/// - **Asset Processing**: Batch processing applications run without user interaction
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// <code>
/// // Safe input service injection with fallback
/// IInputService inputService;
/// try
/// {
///     inputService = new SilkInputService();
///     inputService.Initialize(window);
/// }
/// catch (Exception ex)
/// {
///     logger.LogWarning($"Input initialization failed: {ex.Message}");
///     inputService = new NullInputService(); // Safe fallback
/// }
/// 
/// // Code works normally regardless of input service type
/// if (inputService.KeyboardKeyKeyState.IsKeyDown(Key.W))
/// {
///     // This will never be true with NullInputService
///     player.MoveForward();
/// }
/// 
/// // Unit testing without input complexity
/// [Test]
/// public void TestPlayerMovement()
/// {
///     var game = new Game(new NullInputService(), new NullRenderer());
///     // Test movement logic without requiring keyboard input
/// }
/// 
/// // Automated input recording/playback
/// public class RecordedInputService : IInputService
/// {
///     private readonly List&lt;InputEvent&gt; _recordedInputs;
///     // Playback recorded inputs instead of polling hardware
/// }
