namespace Rac.Input.Mapping;

/// <summary>
/// Defines the contract for input mapping systems that translate hardware input into logical game actions.
/// Enables customizable control schemes and accessibility features for diverse user needs.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// InputMappings provides the foundation for flexible input handling by:
/// - Abstracting hardware-specific input (keyboard keys, mouse buttons, gamepad inputs)
/// - Mapping to logical game actions (jump, attack, menu, pause)
/// - Supporting customizable control schemes and user preferences
/// - Enabling accessibility features and alternative input methods
/// 
/// Educational Note: Input mapping is crucial for game accessibility and user experience:
/// - Players can customize controls to their preferences
/// - Multiple input devices can trigger the same actions
/// - Accessibility features enable broader player access
/// - Localization can adapt to different keyboard layouts
/// 
/// Common Patterns:
/// - Action-based mapping: Map inputs to logical actions rather than specific functions
/// - Context-sensitive bindings: Different mappings for different game modes
/// - Conflict resolution: Handle overlapping or conflicting input assignments
/// - Persistence: Save and load user-customized control schemes
/// 
/// Implementation Status: This interface is currently a placeholder and will be
/// implemented with comprehensive input mapping functionality in future development.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// <code>
/// // Future usage example:
/// var mappings = new InputMappings();
/// mappings.MapAction("Jump", Key.Space);
/// mappings.MapAction("Jump", GamepadButton.A); // Multiple inputs for same action
/// mappings.MapAction("Attack", MouseButton.Left);
/// 
/// // Check mapped actions instead of specific keys
/// if (mappings.IsActionPressed("Jump"))
/// {
///     player.Jump();
/// }
/// </code>
/// </example>

    // TODO: implement InputMappings
    // Future functionality will include:
    // - Action mapping and binding management
    // - Multi-device input support (keyboard, mouse, gamepad)
    // - User customization and persistence
    // - Conflict detection and resolution
    // - Context-sensitive mapping schemes
