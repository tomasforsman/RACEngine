# RACEngine

**RACEngine** is a modular, modern game engine built with .NET 8 and C#. It serves as a learning platform and a foundation for developing custom games without relying on existing game engines. The project emphasizes clarity, separation of concerns, and practical elegance.

## 🚀 Features

* **Entity Component System (ECS):** A clean, idiomatic ECS implementation featuring `Entity`, `IComponent`, `World`, `ISystem`, and `SystemScheduler`.
* **Modular Architecture:** Each subsystem (e.g., AI, Animation, Audio, Assets) resides in its own project/folder, promoting scalability and maintainability.
* **Sample Game:** Includes a sample game demonstrating the engine's capabilities with components like `BoidSystem`, `PositionComponent`, and `VelocityComponent`.([GitHub][1])

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)

### Building the Engine

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tomasforsman/RACEngine.git
   cd RACEngine
   ```

2. **Navigate to the sample game:**

   ```bash
   cd samples/SampleGame
   ```

3. **Build and run the sample game:**

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## 🧪 Sample Game

The `SampleGame` project demonstrates the usage of RACEngine's ECS and other subsystems. It includes:

* **Boid Simulation:** Showcases flocking behavior using `BoidSystem`, `PositionComponent`, and `VelocityComponent`.
* **Obstacle Avoidance:** Implements basic obstacle components to influence boid movement.
* **Species Differentiation:** Utilizes `BoidSpeciesComponent` and `MultiSpeciesBoidSettingsComponent` for varied behaviors.
