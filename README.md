# RACEngine

**RACEngine** is a modular, modern game engine built with .NET 8 and C#. It serves as a learning platform and a foundation for developing custom games without relying on existing game engines. The project emphasizes clarity, separation of concerns, and practical elegance.

## üöÄ Features

* **Entity Component System (ECS):** A clean, idiomatic ECS implementation featuring `Entity`, `IComponent`, `World`, `ISystem`, and `SystemScheduler`.
* **Container System:** Intuitive APIs for spatial relationships with semantic distinction between containment (PlaceIn) and attachment (AttachTo) operations.
* **4-Phase Rendering Pipeline:** Distinct separation of configuration, preprocessing, processing, and post-processing phases for optimal performance and tool development.
* **Modular Architecture:** Each subsystem (e.g., AI, Animation, Audio, Assets) resides in its own project/folder, promoting scalability and maintainability.
* **Sample Games:** Multiple samples demonstrating engine capabilities including boid simulations, rendering effects, and the 4-phase pipeline architecture.

## üé® 4-Phase Rendering Pipeline

RACEngine features a sophisticated rendering architecture that separates concerns into four distinct phases, enabling better performance, tool development, and maintainability.

### Architecture Overview

    A[Configuration] --> B[Preprocessing]
    B --> C[Processing]
    C --> D[Post-Processing]
```

### Phase 1: Configuration
- **Purpose:** Pure data structures defining rendering behavior
- **Characteristics:** No GPU interaction, file I/O, or asset loading
- **Thread-safe:** Immutable configuration with built-in validation
- **Builder pattern:** Complex configuration construction support

```csharp
var config = RenderConfiguration.Create(new Vector2D<int>(1920, 1080))
    .WithPostProcessing(new PostProcessingConfiguration { EnableBloom = true })
    .WithQuality(new QualityConfiguration { MsaaSamples = 4 })
    .Build();
```

### Phase 2: Preprocessing
- **Purpose:** Asset loading, validation, and GPU resource compilation
- **One-time operation:** All expensive operations happen during initialization
- **Comprehensive validation:** Shaders, OpenGL capabilities, dependencies
- **Must complete before rendering:** Enforced by API design

### Phase 3: Processing
- **Purpose:** Fast GPU rendering operations for the main render loop
- **Performance focused:** No asset loading, compilation, or file I/O
- **Optimized state management:** Minimal overhead per frame
- **Main render loop:** Where vertex data becomes pixels

### Phase 4: Post-Processing
- **Purpose:** Screen-space effects applied after main rendering
- **Frame lifecycle:** Proper begin/finalize flow management
- **Configuration-driven:** Effects controlled by Phase 1 configuration
- **Effects include:** Bloom, tone mapping, HDR processing

### Benefits

‚úÖ **Separation of Concerns:** Each phase has a single, clear responsibility  
‚úÖ **Enforced Ordering:** Cannot render without completing preprocessing  
‚úÖ **Performance:** Asset loading never blocks frame rendering  
‚úÖ **Tool Integration:** Each phase can be controlled independently  
‚úÖ **Extensibility:** New features fit clearly into appropriate phases  

### Usage in Engine

The engine automatically manages all four phases:

```csharp
// Happens once during initialization
renderer.Initialize(window);           // Phase 1: Configuration
renderer.InitializePreprocessing();    // Phase 2: Asset loading & validation
renderer.InitializeProcessing();       // Phase 3: GPU resource setup
renderer.InitializePostProcessing();   // Phase 4: Post-processing setup

// Happens every frame in the render loop
renderer.Clear();                      // Phase 3: Begin frame
renderer.UpdateVertices(vertices);     // Phase 3: Upload data
renderer.Draw();                       // Phase 3: Render geometry
renderer.FinalizeFrame();              // Phase 4: Apply effects & present
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)

### System Requirements

For optimal performance and full audiovisual effects support:

* **Graphics:** OpenGL 3.3 or higher
* **Audio:** OpenAL-compatible audio device (automatically handled by Silk.NET.OpenAL)
* **Required OpenGL Extensions:**
  - GL_ARB_framebuffer_object (for post-processing effects)
  - GL_ARB_texture_float (for HDR rendering)

**Note:** The engine will automatically detect your graphics and audio capabilities and gracefully fall back to basic rendering/no audio if requirements aren't met. Update your graphics drivers or use a newer graphics card for full visual effects support. Audio will use the NullAudioService as fallback if OpenAL initialization fails.

### Building the Engine

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tomasforsman/RACEngine.git
   cd RACEngine
   ```

2. **Navigate to the sample game:**

   ```bash
   cd samples/SampleGame
   ```

3. **Build and run the sample game:**

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
